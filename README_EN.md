### Highlight: Market Down, AI Pick Surges +17.42%

**2026-04-13** — The A-share market was broadly declining, with the CSI 500 index down -4.67% over the past 20 days. ClawOS AI issued a **Strong Buy** signal for Tianhua New Energy (300390) — 45 AI experts voted, composite score 80.08, the Trend Trading Expert gave 99% confidence.

Result: **Tianhua New Energy surged +17.42% that day**, profitable from the moment of purchase.

> This isn't hindsight. The signal was generated pre-market, the user confirmed the trade, and the system recorded the entire decision chain.

### How Does It Work?

This isn't luck — it's systematic risk discipline:

- **45 AI Experts Vote** — 30 LLM experts covering 9 dimensions (industry chain, fundamentals, macro, sentiment, etc.) + 15 rule-based experts, triple-stream weighted scoring — no single-indicator guesswork
- **Strict Stop-Loss** — Loss ≥3% triggers immediate sell. The only losing trade (Hengtong Optic) was a disciplined stop-loss exit, preventing deeper drawdown
- **Risk-First** — Major-event veto (MH1), automatic exclusion of newly-listed/suspended stocks, max 3 concurrent positions
- **Twice-Daily Data Collection** — Full collection at 16:00 post-market + incremental update at 07:30 pre-market, so overnight breaking news is never missed
- **Expert Memory System** — Three-tier memory (short/medium/long-term), experts learn from historical mistakes and don't repeat them
- **Human-AI Collaboration** — AI recommends, human decides. Every decision is recorded and fed back for learning

## Why ClawOS?

Most self-hosted dashboards give you a grid of bookmarks. ClawOS gives you an **actual desktop** — with draggable windows, a macOS-style dock, desktop widgets, wallpapers, and 15 integrated apps that talk to each other.

It's designed for **one person**: you. Single-user, single-machine, zero cloud dependency. Access it remotely through Tailscale or any VPN, and everything just works.

### Highlights

- **Full Desktop Shell** — Dock, window management, wallpapers, notification center, system tray
- **AI Stock Analysis** — A-share market signals, multi-expert voting, position risk control, performance replay
- **Media Center** — NetEase Cloud Music streaming, local music library, video search & HLS playback
- **Productivity Suite** — Markdown notes with rich-text editor, Dida365 (TickTick) integration, RSS daily briefings
- **File & Cloud** — FileBrowser for local files, Baidu & Quark cloud drives via AList
- **System Monitor** — Real-time CPU/RAM/disk/network widgets, systemd service health dashboard
- **Downloads** — Aria2-powered download manager with speed display and queue management

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAWOS_PASSWORD` | `~/.clawos/.env` | Login password for Basic Auth (username: `clawos`) |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | `~/.openclaw/.env` | OpenClaw gateway authentication token |
| `PORT` | env | Backend listen port (default: `3001`) |
| `DIDA_CLIENT_ID` / `DIDA_CLIENT_SECRET` | env | Dida365 OAuth credentials |
| `BAIDU_NETDISK_CLIENT_ID` / `BAIDU_NETDISK_CLIENT_SECRET` | env | Baidu Netdisk OAuth credentials |

### Path Configuration

All working directories are configurable via the Settings UI or `~/.clawos/config.json`:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "downloadsDir": "~/Downloads",
    "musicDownloadsDir": "~/Music",
    "notesDir": "~/Documents/Notes",
    "readerDir": "~/Documents/RSS",
    "stockAnalysisDir": "~/Documents/StockAnalysis",
    "videoDownloadsDir": "~/Videos"
  }
}
```

## Authentication

- All routes are protected by **HTTP Basic Auth** (username: `clawos`)
- Frontend includes a built-in login screen
- FileBrowser proxy uses a secondary cookie-based auth (`clawos_filebrowser_auth`)
- Local music streaming uses cookie auth (`clawos_media_auth`) since `<audio>` tags can't send Auth headers
- If `CLAWOS_PASSWORD` is not set, auth is skipped (local development only)

## External Services

All external services are **optional**. The core desktop and apps work without them.

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Aria2 | 6800 | Download engine |
| AList | 5244 | Cloud drive mounting (Baidu/Quark) |
| FileBrowser | 18790 | Local file management UI |
| OpenClaw | 18789 | AI chat gateway |

## systemd Services

`install-systemd.sh` sets up user-level services:

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| `clawos.service` | Main backend (Node.js) |
| `clawos-filebrowser.service` | FileBrowser instance |
| `clawos-watchdog.timer` | Health check every 10 min, auto-restart on failure |
| `clawos-display-inhibit.service` | Prevent display sleep for remote access |

## Testing

```bash
# Backend tests
npm --prefix backend test

# Frontend tests
npm --prefix frontend test

# Type checking only
npx --prefix frontend tsc --noEmit
npx --prefix backend tsc --noEmit
```

## FAQ

**Can I use it without Aria2/AList/OpenClaw?**  
Yes. These are optional integrations. The corresponding features will show as unavailable, but everything else works fine.

**How do I access it remotely?**  
The backend binds to `127.0.0.1:3001` by default (no external exposure). Use Tailscale, WireGuard, or a reverse proxy for remote access.

**How do I update?**  
```bash
git pull
./scripts/build.sh
systemctl --user restart clawos.service
```
